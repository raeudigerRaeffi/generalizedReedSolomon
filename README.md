# Generalized Reed Solomon Code
This is an implementation of a special kind of Reed Solomon Code called Generalized Reed Solomon code according to the paper "A Class of Generalized RS-Codes with Faster
Encoding and Decoding Algorithms" by Amin Shokrollahi. A version of the paper can be found at https://ita.ucsd.edu/workshop/13/files/paper/paper_1421.pdf.

This special code can be sped up by a factor of p, since the code can be parallelized over p components. Additionally it allows to construct codes of arbitrary length as long as n%p == 0 is fulfilled and a primitive root of unity p can be found in the corresponding field over which the code is constructed. Whereas the standard Reed Solomon code imposes n= q^m -1. The code can be constructed over all Galois Fields.

## Documentation
n = k + r <br/>
k = message symbols sent <br/>
r = number of parity symbols <br/>
p = speed up factor <br/>

Currently the code can also handle codes where n %p != 0 however only if r is still divisble by p.
### Class Generalized_Reed_Solomon
```
class Generalized_Reed_Solomon(
field_size:int, #q characterisitc of the field
message_length:int, # n
payload_length:int, # k
symbol_size:int, #m exponent of field. Order of field is q^m
p_factor:int, #p speedup factor
irr_poly=None:array, # optional in case that the galois libary has not a precomputed irreducible polynominal
multi_processing = False, #optional when True certain parts of the code will be parallelized this is however currently only efficent when operating with long messages
debug=False # can be set to true in order to have the steps printed to the console
)
```
### Generalized_Reed_Solomon.encode()
```
Generalized_Reed_Solomon.encode(self,array)
# Takes as an argument a list and appends parity symbols to it
```
### Generalized_Reed_Solomon.decode()
```
Generalized_Reed_Solomon.decode(self, recieved_msg)
# Takes as an argument a list of a encoded message. Detects and corrects errors and then returns the k info symbols
```
### Generalized_Reed_Solomon.convert_to_symbol_array()
```
Generalized_Reed_Solomon.convert_to_symbol_array(self,array)
# Takes as an argument a list values and converts them to galois elements. If the degree of field > 1, the list will beÂ´a list of list
# where each list represents the coefficents of a Galois element of the corresponding Field
```

### Generalized_Reed_Solomon.symbol_array_to_array()
```
Generalized_Reed_Solomon.symbol_array_to_array(self,array)
# Takes a list of ints as an argument. Performs the reverse of convert_to_symbol_array(). Transforms each Galois field element in the list
# into its coefficent representation.
```

## TODO
1. Add case for r % p != 0 <br/>
2. Add parallelization(done for fft)
